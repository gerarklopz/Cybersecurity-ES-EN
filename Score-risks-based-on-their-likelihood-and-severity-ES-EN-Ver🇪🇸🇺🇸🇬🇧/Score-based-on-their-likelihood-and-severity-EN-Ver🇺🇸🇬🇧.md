# **Risk Assessment: Archdiocese Administration Analysis En-VerðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§**  
*Kangodrila Solutions - Risk Assessment Report*  

## **1. Operational Environment Description**  
The Archdiocese of X City is facing significant challenges in managing its financial data, ecclesiastical records, and communications with the Holy See. The institution is currently experiencing administrative difficulties that have led to critical errors, potentially impacting transparency, security, and operational efficiency.  

One of the key factors identified is the lack of IT training among the religious staff responsible for these tasks, who are specialized in Canon Law and Theology. Additionally, various laypeople and collaborators with IT experience have expressed concerns about the current situation. The Holy See is aware of these difficulties, and delegates are expected to visit for evaluation, alongside monitoring by the Spanish Episcopal Conference.  

## **2. Implementation of the NIST/CSF Framework**  
The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a widely used reference framework to improve organizational cybersecurity. Its implementation will allow the Archdiocese to better structure its digital security processes and move towards a more mature and efficient protection model. The framework consists of three key elements:  

- **Core**: Defines five essential functions for managing cybersecurity risk: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**. These functions will help understand and address threats in a structured way.  
- **Tiers**: Evaluates the current level of cybersecurity maturity, classifying it into one of four levels: **Tier 1 (Partial), Tier 2 (Risk Managed), Tier 3 (Risk Mitigated), and Tier 4 (Adaptive)**. This will provide insight into the Archdiocese's digital security preparedness.  
- **Profiles**: Determines the most suitable security profile based on the institution's specific needs and risks, allowing the framework to be personalized to the Archdiocese's reality.  

### **Breakdown of the NIST CSF Key Functions**

1. **Identify**:  
It is essential to know the Archdiocese's digital assets, assess existing risks, and understand present vulnerabilities. This includes creating an inventory of critical systems and data, as well as defining responsibilities within the organization. A specific example would be identifying the sacramental registry databases and classifying them by importance.

2. **Protect**:  
Measures need to be established to safeguard information and systems from potential attacks or failures. Key strategies include multi-factor authentication, data encryption, and training staff in best security practices. For example, implementing access policies and using secure passwords for the financial management system.

3. **Detect**:  
Implement mechanisms that allow for the quick identification of security incidents. This involves continuous network monitoring, the use of intrusion detection tools, and generating alerts for suspicious behaviors. In the Archdioceseâ€™s case, monitoring tools could be used to detect unauthorized access attempts to sensitive databases.

4. **Respond**:  
Have detailed action plans in place to mitigate the impact of a security incident. This involves defining communication protocols, assigning roles in case of a crisis, and coordinating effective responses to attacks or system failures. The Archdiocese should have a clear communication protocol with the Holy See in case of incidents.

5. **Recover**:  
Develop strategies to restore affected systems and minimize disruptions to the Archdioceseâ€™s operations. Recommended measures include regular backups and creating a business continuity plan. Restoring ecclesiastical records from cloud backups should be a priority in this case.

## **3. Risk Identification and Assessment**  
Below are the main risks identified, with their respective **Probability (1-3)** and **Severity (1-3)** values, according to the risk assessment model. Probability reflects the estimated frequency of risk occurrence, while severity measures the impact it could have on the institution's operations. The combination of both values helps determine the priority for intervention.  

| **Risk** | **Description** | **Probability (1-3)** | **Severity (1-3)** | **Priority (P x S)** |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **1. Disorder in Financial Management** | Errors in recording donations during a month, affecting transparency and auditability. | 3 | 3 | **9 (Critical)** |
| **2. Loss of Baptismal Records Database (1999)** | Accidental deletion of essential sacramental records. The situation is worsened by the use of expired Oracle licenses and lack of technical support. | 3 | 3 | **9 (Critical)** |
| **3. Incorrect Documentation Sent to the Holy See** | Incorrect information about a priest sent to the Vatican. The email account used is a Gmail account with no security protocols or standardization. | 2 | 2 | **4 (Moderate)** |
| **4. Lack of Backups and Data Security** | Absence of up-to-date backups for sensitive records, compromising data integrity. | 3 | 3 | **9 (Critical)** |
| **5. Absence of Validation Procedures** | No double-check procedures in the management of finances and official documentation. | 2 | 3 | **6 (High)** |

## **4. Risk Mitigation Plan**  
To address the identified risks, Kangodrila Solutions recommends implementing the following corrective measures:  

### **ðŸ”¹ For Financial Management:**  
âœ… Implementation of accounting software with automatic auditing.  
âœ… Establishment of a double-check protocol before closing the monthly accounting records.  
âœ… Staff training in financial management and auditing regulations.  

### **ðŸ”¹ For Loss of Data in Records:**  
âœ… Data recovery using specialized forensic data recovery tools.  
âœ… Implementation of automatic cloud backups with geographical redundancy.  
âœ… Creation of offline backups for critical documentation.  
âœ… Regularization of software licenses and contracting of specialized technical support.  

### **ðŸ”¹ For Communication Management with the Holy See:**  
âœ… Mandatory validation by the General Vicar before sending official information.  
âœ… Implementation of a digital signature and document encryption system.  
âœ… Creation of an official email domain and application of secure email management policies.  

### **ðŸ”¹ For Data Security and Backups:**  
âœ… Development and implementation of an Information Security Management System (ISMS).  
âœ… Use of advanced encryption for databases and restricted access with multi-factor authentication.  
âœ… Quarterly internal audits to validate the compliance of security protocols.  

### **ðŸ”¹ For Document Validation:**  
âœ… Establishment of a three-level review protocol before approving financial and documentary records.  
âœ… Creation of a Document Quality Control Committee to ensure information accuracy.  
âœ… Implementation of a ticketing system for tracking and tracing administrative tasks.
