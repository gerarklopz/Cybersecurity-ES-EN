# Internal Security Audit Report for Botium Toys

## Background and Scenario

Botium Toys is a small U.S.-based business that specializes in the development and sale of toys. With the expansion of its online presence, the company has experienced rapid growth, attracting customers both domestically and internationally. As a result, the Information Technology (IT) department faces increasing pressure to support this expanded online market.

The IT department manager decided to conduct an internal IT audit to maintain compliance with evolving regulations and to ensure business continuity as the company grows. The audit is focused on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. A particular concern is to ensure compliance with internal payment processing regulations and international regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU).

The audit is being conducted using the **National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)**. This framework helps to identify the existing risks and gaps in the companyâ€™s security posture. The audit also aims to evaluate whether the necessary controls are in place and to assess the impact of non-compliance with applicable regulations.

## Objective of the Audit

- **Review the scope, goals, and risk assessment report** created by the IT manager.
- **Perform an internal audit** by completing the controls and compliance checklist.
- **Evaluate the security posture** of Botium Toys and identify areas where controls need to be implemented to improve security and compliance.

## Answers to the Task Questions

### 1. Review of Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

- **Response**: **Yes**, I carefully reviewed the risk assessment report, objectives, and the scope of the internal audit. The IT department manages several assets, including office equipment, employee devices, products for sale, and critical systems such as accounting, telecommunications, databases, and ecommerce. A risk assessment revealed that Botium Toys has inadequate controls in place and lacks full compliance with regulations like **GDPR** and **PCI DSS**.

- **Additional Comment**: The review of the scope and goals is essential to identify vulnerable areas and high-risk points that can be addressed through security controls and compliance best practices.

- **Recommendation**: The IT department must implement strong asset management procedures and ensure all assets are properly identified and classified according to their value to the organization.

### 2. Consideration of Risks for Customers, Employees, and Assets

- **Response**: **Yes**, I considered the risks for customers, employees, and assets. The company faces risks such as unauthorized access to sensitive customer data (e.g., credit card information and PII) due to the lack of encryption and proper access controls. There are also risks arising from the absence of a disaster recovery plan and critical data backups.

- **Additional Comment**: By implementing best compliance practices such as the NIST CSF framework, firewalls, antivirus, and encryption, these risks can be effectively mitigated.

- **Recommendation**: Botium Toys should implement encryption for sensitive data, adopt stricter access controls based on the **principle of least privilege**, and develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.

### 3. Review of Control Categories Document

- **Response**: **Yes**, I reviewed the control categories document. This document outlines the necessary best practices and controls required to maintain security and regulatory compliance. Reviewing the control categories allowed me to structure solutions for improving the security posture of Botium Toys.

- **Additional Comment**: The control categories document is vital for establishing a structured approach to security and ensuring that the necessary measures are implemented consistently across the organization.

- **Recommendation**: The IT department should continuously monitor and review control categories to ensure that security measures and best practices are consistently applied.

### 4. Selection of "Yes" or "No" for Each Listed Control

- **Response**: **Yes**, I selected "yes" or "no" for each control listed in the checklist. The responses were based on the evaluation of Botium Toys' infrastructure, focusing on improving internal security, protecting sensitive data, and complying with regulations.

- **Additional Comment**: It is essential to verify each control based on the current state of the company's security infrastructure to take corrective actions where necessary.

### 5. Selection of "Yes" or "No" for Each Compliance Best Practice

- **Response**: **Yes**, I selected "yes" or "no" for each compliance best practice. The necessary best practices include stricter password policies, encryption of sensitive data, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and the implementation of firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

- **Additional Comment**: Compliance with regulations like PCI DSS and GDPR is critical for protecting data integrity and confidentiality and avoiding penalties from regulatory authorities.

- **Recommendation**: Botium Toys should enhance its compliance posture by ensuring full implementation of regulatory frameworks, particularly **GDPR** and **PCI DSS**, with the help of a dedicated compliance officer.

1. **Implement an access control system based on the least privilege principle**.
2. **Strengthen firewalls and antivirus systems** with customized configurations and regular updates.
3. **Encrypt sensitive data**, such as credit card information and PII, using industry-standard algorithms like AES-256.
4. **Improve physical security** with biometric or card-based access controls.
5. **Develop and implement a disaster recovery plan (DRP)**, including full, incremental, and differential backups.
6. **Strengthen password policies**, requiring complex passwords and applying multi-factor authentication (MFA).

By implementing these controls and best practices, Botium Toys will significantly improve its security posture and comply with relevant regulations, protecting both its assets and customer data.
