---

## Introduction to Threat Modeling

**Threat Modeling** allows you to identify and anticipate security risks **before** they occur, structuring defenses from the design phase.

> It's thinking like an attacker to build like a defender.

---

## Threat Model Process ‚Äì Key Stages

| Step | Action | Example in What2SMS |
|------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Identify assets | Messages, users, API, backend. |
| 2 | List actors | Hackers, scripts, insiders. |
| 3 | Analyze threats | Spoofing, data leakage, unauthorized access. |
| 4 | Model attacks | Phishing, interception, manipulation. |
| 5 | Assess impact/probability | Critical vs. acceptable risks. |
| 6 | Apply controls | Encryption, validations, authentication. |

---

## PASTA Framework ‚Äì Phased Security Process

**PASTA** = **P**rocess for **A**ttack **S**imulation and **T**hreat **A**nalysis**

A modern and structured approach to assessing risks by aligning security and system objectives.

| Phase | Approach | Application in What2SMS |
|------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| I | Business objectives | Redirect WhatsApp to SMS without apps. |
| II | Technical scope | WhatsApp Web, modular backend, SMS gateway, sockets. Technologies prioritized for their compatibility with classic mobile devices, low resource requirements, and ease of integration without closed dependencies. <br><br>**Justification:**<br>‚Ä¢ *WhatsApp Web* allows capturing messages without an official API.<br>‚Ä¢ *Sockets* allow real-time communication without polling.<br>‚Ä¢ *Modular backend* allows scaling, splitting functions, and applying layered security.<br>‚Ä¢ *API SMS Gateway* guarantees delivery to unconnected devices.<br>‚Ä¢ *PKI and tokens* ensure authentication and spoofing protection.<br>‚Ä¢ *AES/SHA-256* encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.<br>‚Ä¢ *SQL* guarantees integrity, persistence, and auditing. |
| III | Data flow modeling | WhatsApp ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí SMS ‚Üí User. |
| IV | Threat identification | Unauthorized access, spoofing, exposure. |
| V | Vulnerability analysis | Open APIs, weak validations. |
| VI | Attack simulation | Sniffing, abusive automation. |
| VII | Controls and Mitigations | Encryption, Authentication, Flow Control |

## **What2SMS Under the PASTA Microscope**

This model allows you to anticipate real risks and apply specific defenses to mitigate identified threats:

---

### üîê **Main Risks:**

- **SMS Interception**: Risk of messages being read by unauthorized actors.
- **Wrong Redirects**: Possibility of messages being diverted to the wrong recipients.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data**: Unauthorized access to personal or confidential information.
- **External Policy Violations**: Misuse of WhatsApp and other platforms without proper permissions.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Applied Defenses:**

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **Issuer Validation**
**What is it?**
Confirms that the origin of a message is legitimate, preventing impersonation.

**How ‚Äã‚Äãis it implemented?**
- **Digital signatures (PKI)**: Verification using public and private keys.
- **Number/issuer whitelist**: Acceptance only from trusted sources.
- **JWT token validation**: Ensures the authenticity of the sender through secure authentication.

---

#### üîí **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**
**What is it?**
Protects the confidentiality of messages throughout the entire process, from sender to receiver.

**How ‚Äã‚Äãis it implemented?**
- **AES-256**: Strong message encryption in transit.
- **RSA/ECDH**: Secure key exchange between the sender and receiver.
- **Final decryption**: The message can only be read by the receiver, with no exposure during transit.

---

#### üìù **Activity Logs and Alerts**
**What is it?**
Constant monitoring of actions performed by the system to detect incidents and generate reports.

**How ‚Äã‚Äãis it implemented?**
- **Logging Systems**: Examples such as ELK stack, Loki, or Fluentd to store detailed logs (IP, time, action, user).
- **Automatic alerts**: Notification by email or webhook in the event of suspicious or anomalous activity.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Automation Control**
**What is it?**
Prevents abuse of the service by bots or unauthorized users.

**How ‚Äã‚Äãis it implemented?**
- **Rate limiting**: Restrictions on the number of messages per minute (e.g., 10 messages/minute per user).
- **Captchas**: Human vs. machine validations to prevent automated interactions.
- **Automated behavior detection**: Use of machine learning algorithms or predefined rules to identify and block suspicious activity.

---

## How do we approach it?

- We apply **PASTA** as an analytical framework.
- We use **DFDs** and **attack trees** to visualize flows and threats.
- We design controls from the beginning of development.

---


## Final Evaluation

We have built a resilient system focused on security, knowing that **protection is not static**. We will continue to audit and adapt the model as the project and its risks evolve.
