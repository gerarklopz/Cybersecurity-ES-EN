# Cybersecurity Audit for Electoral Security EN-VerðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

**Company Name:** Kangodrila Solutions

## **Background**

A public tendered company has been designated to manage the vote counting process in the "X" autonomous community. The Electoral Board of this community has delegated the technological management of the electoral process to this company. However, the national intelligence service has identified irregularities in the process and hired an external cybersecurity team to discreetly investigate, acting as an intermediary (frontman).

Given the urgency of the electoral process and the lack of specialized personnel within the awarded company, a technical employee has gained unauthorized access to sensitive information, violating fundamental principles such as the **Information Privacy Principle** and the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**. This employee, whose specific technical rank has not yet been defined, has begun implementing fraudulent software without proper oversight.

## **Incident Summary**

The leaked information suggests that hidden files exist within the source code of the electoral program, which have been camouflaged using techniques such as **steganography** and **obfuscation**. These files allow data manipulation without being detected by conventional audits. The cybersecurity team has precise information on how to proceed to locate and neutralize this threat before it is activated.

#### **More Information on Steganography and Obfuscation**:

**Steganography**:
Steganography is a technique used to hide information within another file or medium in a way that makes it undetectable to the naked eye. In the electoral context, this technique can be used to insert malicious or secret data into seemingly harmless files (such as images or documents) with the goal of manipulating or stealing information without being detected.

For example, in an electoral system, an attacker could hide malicious code in an image of a candidate or in a file that appears to be part of legitimate software. The idea is that even if the file is viewed or audited, the hidden information is not detected because it is disguised.

**Obfuscation**:
Obfuscation, on the other hand, is the process of making code or data more difficult for an examiner to understand. This is achieved by altering the program's source code so that it still functions correctly, but is difficult for an auditor or security analyst to read or interpret. Obfuscation does not change the purpose of the code, but it makes it harder to analyze.

### **Priorities**:

- Extract irrefutable evidence.
- Identify the execution path of the malicious software.
- Track external connections to determine if external actors are involved.

## **Learning Objectives for Non-Specialized Managers**

- **Explain the importance of the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** in protecting data and ensuring the integrity of the electoral system.
- **Identify flaws** in the application of PoLP that have allowed this vulnerability and put security at risk.
- **Provide concrete strategies** to mitigate these risks in future electoral processes.

## **Cybersecurity Audit Plan**

### **1. Access Control and Privilege Review**

- Exhaustive audit of permissions in critical electoral process systems.
- Removal of unnecessary and unjustified privileges to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Implementation of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to grant privileges only to users who truly need them.

#### **More on RBAC:**

RBAC is a security model used to restrict access to systems based on the role a user has within the organization. Implementing it ensures that only employees with specific roles have access to sensitive information and critical electoral operations.

### **2. Log Analysis and Anomaly Detection**

- Historical review of accesses and activities to identify any suspicious or unauthorized behavior.
- Implementation of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools to monitor and detect unusual behavior.

#### **Recommended SIEM Tools:**

- **Splunk:** Extensive analysis capabilities for large companies, ideal for processing large volumes of data.
- **IBM QRadar:** Uses artificial intelligence to detect security events and help cybersecurity teams perform more efficient analysis.
- **Elastic Security (ELK Stack):** A flexible, open-source option that works well in various environments.
- **Microsoft Sentinel:** A cloud-based solution that integrates well with other Microsoft tools, ideal for Azure environments.

ðŸ’¡ **Best practice:** Configure real-time alerts to detect suspicious access and correlate unusual events for a more agile response.

### **3. Data Encryption and Security Policies**

- **Encryption at rest and in transit** to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.
- **Restriction of external transmissions** to prevent data from being leaked or modified outside the controlled system.
  - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Solutions like Microsoft Purview DLP or Symantec DLP can be configured to block unauthorized transmission of sensitive data.
  - **Restriction of cloud service access:** Prevent using services like Google Drive or Dropbox on corporate devices to protect data integrity.
  - **Network traffic monitoring:** Tools like Zeek or Suricata are used to inspect suspicious external connections and prevent leaks.

### **4. Implementation of Least Privilege**

- Use of **multifactor authentication (MFA)** to strengthen security when accessing critical systems.
- **Temporary restriction** of access for specific tasks, with automatic privilege revocation when no longer needed.
- **Automatic revocation of inactive privileges** to ensure no one retains access unnecessarily.

### **5. Internal Threat Prevention and Training**

- Continuous data security training for all staff, with an emphasis on handling sensitive information appropriately.
- A confidential reporting channel for employees to safely report any suspicious activity.
  - **Guaranteed anonymity:** Use of platforms like WhistleB to protect the identity of whistleblowers.
  - **Restricted access for trusted investigators** to ensure investigations are carried out without compromising confidentiality.
  - **Immediate action protocols** to swiftly verify reports without damaging employees' reputations.

ðŸ’¡ **Best practice:** Establish rewards for employees who report irregularities before they escalate into major incidents.

### **6. Incident Response and Crisis Management**

- Configuration of **real-time alerts** for rapid detection and response to incidents.
- **Rapid response team** ready to act in any cyber crisis or incident.
- Cybersecurity drills with **red and blue teams**:
  - **Red Team:** Conducts simulated attacks to test defense effectiveness.
  - **Blue Team:** Responds to attacks and continually improves defenses.

ðŸ’¡ **Best practice:** Integrate a **Purple Team** approach, where the **Blue Team** continuously learns from the **Red Team** to improve defense capabilities.

## **Recommendations for Improving Electoral Security**

### **1. Strengthen Access Controls**

- Perform regular access reviews for all critical systems to maintain a dynamic security policy.
- Strictly apply **RBAC** to minimize unauthorized access risks.

#### **More on RBAC:**

Implementing the RBAC model is crucial to ensure that only employees with the appropriate privilege levels can access confidential information. This should be regularly reviewed and adjusted to ensure access is aligned with the needs of the electoral process.

### **2. Implement Advanced Monitoring**

- Implement **AI-based behavior analysis** to detect suspicious patterns in real-time.
- Create a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** 24/7 to constantly monitor the security of electoral systems.

### **3. Apply the Zero Trust Model**

- Verify the identity of all users before granting access to any system.
- Implement **network microsegmentation** to limit access to different sections of the network based on the user's role.

### **4. Improve Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**

- Monitor and control transfers of sensitive data to prevent leaks.
- Implement **encryption** and **watermarking** in confidential documents.
- **Restrict USB use** in critical environments to prevent data leakage through removable devices:
  - **Disable USB ports** on high-risk devices.
  - Use **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** systems like Microsoft Intune to control data access and transfers.
  - Implement **automatic encryption** on removable devices like BitLocker To Go or VeraCrypt to protect data in case of loss or theft of devices.

### **5. Increase Audits and Transparency**

- Conduct **periodic independent audits** to ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.
- Comply with international standards such as **ISO 27001**, **NIST SP 800-53**, and **GDPR** to ensure data security and privacy.
