### **International Mobility Consulting and Network-Connected Asset Classification**

**Network-Connected Asset Classification:**

At the aforementioned company, we classify network-connected assets according to their **sensitivity** and **criticality** for operations. This classification allows us to prioritize security measures and ensure the protection of the most sensitive data. Below, we detail the key assets and recommendations for their protection:

#### **1. Data Centers (Servers) - Sensitivity: üî¥ Confidential**
- **Reason:** Servers house critical information such as financial data, customer and supplier records. Their loss or exposure could have serious consequences.
- **Recommendations:**
- **Strict physical access control:** We limit access to authorized personnel.
- **Data encryption:** We use strong standards such as AES-256 and TLS to protect data in transit and at rest.
- **Redundancy and Backups:** We implemented a high-availability system with geographic redundancy and cloud backups.

#### **2. Main Platform (Cloud App) - Sensitivity: üî¥ Confidential**
- **Reason:** The app manages remote access and processing of sensitive data, so its compromise could generate significant risks.
- **Recommendations:**
- **Regular Security Testing:** We perform periodic penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** We implement MFA in all interactions with the platform, especially for administrator access.
- **DDoS Protection:** We use tools such as AWS Shield or Cloudflare to mitigate distributed denial of service attacks.

#### **3. Databases (Inventory) - Sensitivity: üü† High**
- **Reason:** Although they do not contain direct financial data, they are vital for logistics and supply chain management.
- **Recommendations:**
- **Database Segmentation:** We ensure that inventory databases are separated from customer databases to limit the impact of a compromise.
- **Transaction Monitoring:** We implement monitoring tools to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity.

#### **4. Communication Systems (Videoconferencing, VoIP) - Sensitivity: üü° Medium**
- **Reason:** Internal communications are essential, but they do not directly handle sensitive data.
- **Recommendations:**
- **End-to-end Encryption:** We ensure that all communications are encrypted, both in transit and in storage.
- **Identity Management (IAM):** We control access to communication platforms using identity management tools.

#### **5. Firewalls and VPNs - Sensitivity: üî¥ Confidential**
- **Reason:** They are the first line of defense against unauthorized access.
- **Recommendations:**
- **Continuous review of firewall rules:** We conduct regular audits to ensure there are no misconfigurations.
- **MFA on VPNs:** We implement multi-factor authentication on VPN connections to add an extra layer of security.

#### **6. IoT Sensors and Production Equipment - Sensitivity: üü¢ Low**
- **Reason:** They do not contain sensitive data, but are essential for productivity.
- **Recommendations:**
- **Real-time monitoring:** We implement monitoring systems to detect failures or interruptions.
- **Critical Equipment Redundancy:** We ensure that the most critical equipment has redundancy to avoid prolonged outages.

- **Cybersecurity Software:** We implement tools such as Fortinet or Palo Alto Networks for network protection, along with intrusion detection solutions (IDS/IPS) such as Suricata. For endpoint protection, we use ClamAV or Sophos, both compatible with Linux.

3. **Firewall and VPN:**
- **Physical Firewall:** We use firewalls from well-known brands such as FortiGate or Palo Alto Networks to secure the perimeter network.
- **VPN:** We implement Proton VPN and WireGuard to create secure, lightweight connections between offices and for remote access.

4. **Backups and Data Recovery:**
- **3-2-1 Strategy:** We maintain three copies of data, on two different media types (cloud and local), with one copy offsite (on Google Cloud, for example).
- **Backup Tools:** We use AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage for automatic backups, along with Rsync and Bacula to manage local copies on Linux servers.

5. **Network and Security Monitoring:**
- **SIEM:** We implement security information and event management (SIEM) systems such as Splunk or ELK Stack to monitor traffic and detect potential threats in real time.
