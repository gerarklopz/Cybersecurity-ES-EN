# Security Analysis: Corporate Card Misuse (AAA Framework)EN-Verüá∫üá∏üá¨üáß
## üîê Case Context

**Scenario:**
During the 2020 pandemic lockdown (April), recurring expenses for personal services (Netflix, Spotify, household purchases) were recorded using the CEO's corporate card.
Total recorded: 63 transactions (‚âà‚Ç¨4,500) with no business justification.

### üìä Suspicious Expenses Table (Summary)

| Date | Provider | Amount (‚Ç¨) | Pattern Detected |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 2020-04-01 | Netflix | 12.91 | 12 transactions in 30 days |
| 2020-04-03 | Amazon | 207.50 | Fragmented purchases (3/day) |
| 2020-04-22 | Apple Store | 313.24 | Larger sum hidden in 3 payments |
| 2020-04-30 | Zara Home | 136.91 | Last day of recurring month |

### üîç AAA Framework Applied

The AAA framework, which stands for **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**, is a security framework used to control and track access within a computer network, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources and monitoring their activities.

Here's a breakdown:
- **Authentication**:
This process verifies the identity of a user or device attempting to access a resource, typically using credentials such as usernames and passwords, or other methods such as biometric data.

- **Authorization**:
Once authenticated, authorization determines which resources and actions the user or device can access, based on their role or privileges.
- **Accounting/Auditing**:
This component tracks and records user activities, including the resources accessed, the time of access, and the actions performed, providing an audit trail for security monitoring and analysis.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication

| Component | Findings | Risk Identified |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Login/IP** | Same private IP as CEO | No MFA for transactions |
| **Device** | Exclusive use of your corporate mobile device | No registration of authorized devices |

**Recommendations**:
‚úî Implement Phishing-resistant MFA (e.g., FIDO2/WebAuthn) for online payments
‚úî Log authorized IP addresses/devices with anomaly alerts
‚úî Implement a unique password policy (do not reuse passwords across multiple services)
‚úî Revoke access immediately upon termination of employment

**Device Registration**
‚úî Jamf/Intune for:
‚úî Allowlist/Blocklist  of authorized IMEIs
‚úî Zero-touch remote erase in case of loss/theft

## Related Information:
**Intune**
Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based device and application management (Endpoint Management) solution that allows companies to centrally and securely manage and protect devices, applications, and users, integrating with other Microsoft services such as Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365.

**IMEI**
The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique 15-digit code that uniquely identifies each mobile phone, similar to a serial number, and is transmitted to the network each time the device connects.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authorization

| Component | Findings | Identified Risk |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Policies** | No signed document | Ambiguous ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù spending |
| **Limits** | No control over amounts | CEO could argue ‚Äúpandemic urgency‚Äù |
| **End of collaboration** | No frequency control | Former employees with current privileges
|

**Recommendations**:
‚úî Create an expense policy with:
- Allowlist/Blocklist  of allowed suppliers
- Monthly limits per category
- Approval requirement for purchases >‚Ç¨100

1. [X] **Automatic Revocation**:
- Deactivate accounts after 30 days of inactivity
- Quarterly audit of active users

2. [X] **Access Hierarchy**:

A[CEO] (Chief Executive Officer) -->|Dual approval| B(Purchases >‚Ç¨200)
B --> C[CFO] (Chief Financial Officer)
D[Former employees] -->|Access denied| B

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Accounting / Audit

| Component | Findings | Identified Risk |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Digital Trace**| Invoices without detailed descriptions | Impossible to distinguish between work and personal use |
| **Alerts** | No system detected patterns | 63 transactions in 30 days went unnoticed |

**Recommendations**:
‚úî Implement an automatic expense classification system
‚úî Real-time alerts for:
- Purchases during non-working hours
- Allowlist/Blocklist (e.g., Netflix)

Test Fails Technical Recommendation
No MFA in transactions IP 152.207.255.255 (personal VPN) Implement Authy for payments >‚Ç¨50
Unaudited device Same IMEI as CEO mobile (not corporate) Register devices with Jamf
Critical Data:
12 Netflix purchases (‚Ç¨180.62) from CEO's residential IP.

## Related Information:
**Authy**
Why might we use two-factor authentication?
Relying solely on usernames and passwords to protect our online accounts may not be secure. Data breaches occur daily, and hackers are always looking for new ways to access our accounts. Protecting ourselves by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) will verify our identity across devices and block access to potential data theft. By enabling 2FA now, we will protect our online accounts.

**Jamf**
They help organizations achieve success with Apple.
Automate and scale Apple IT and security workflows.
Purchasing Apple hardware is only part of the technology equation. How you protect, manage, and empower your end users with technology makes all the difference.
Why? Jamf has nearly 20 years of experience, an unmatched reputation for immediate support for the Apple operating system, and a comprehensive security and management platform to extend the Apple experience.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Ambiguous Authorization**
**Nonexistent Policies**:
- ‚ùå No limits on household purchases.
- ‚ùå "Urgent" justification used for Uber Eats/Glovo.

**Proposed Solution**:
```markdown
1. [X] Allowlist/Blocklist Vendor:
- Netflix, Spotify, Zara Home
2. [X] Dual approval for purchases >‚Ç¨200 (CEO + CFO)
3. [X] Geofencing: Block purchases outside the EU
